## Logo is needed for our Labsite..

Applied Machine Learning Laboratory(abbreviation - AML) from Seoul National University Graduate School of Data Science is founded by Dr. Wen-Syan Li, who is my advisor. Using Apache, server based Ubuntu was builted completely, using docs format as Wordpress. I proudly share the domain of it

<http://aml.gsds.snu.ac.kr>

To visualize the concept of what our lab focuses on, I designed the logo by the process as follows.


## 0. Concept

<img src = "/assets/img/amllogo/concept.png" width = "300">  

I focused on three concepts. No more, No less. **The first** is **Name**. Abstracting image can be added but that task is easy for apple because all people know and have commonsense in the shape of apple. Applied Machine Learning Lab itself has many syntaxes and contexts in it so that alphabet should be revealed. Also, A, M and L, three alphabets is good alphabet to combine.

**The Second** is **Message**. Logo is for showing vision and misson. I wanted to add message in it. 

**The Last and the most important** is **Color**. Color is another visual language that let people to recognize the compassion, emotion in the image. Colors were picked to maximize the effect of it.


## 1. Name

Using Apple Pencil in Procreate App., I symbolized A, M and L but it was not easy task. A and M have triangle in it but L is just the connection of two straight line. So that I passed the alphabet drawing process and moved on to the next step.

## 2. Message

AML was founded summer this year. Exploding research and application of AI can be seen these days. I want to express the first message as 'Boat'. Boats go their own way in the vast ocean. This message is applied.

<br><br>
$$\text{BOAT}$$

I drew simple vectors expressing both 'AML' and 'BOATS'. And this came out
<img src = "/assets/img/amllogo/fig2.png" width = "200">

This figure looks like boat. And also, three alphabets can be found, not fully though. Finally, next stage, color will be applied to this symbol.

## 3. Color
I picked color considering two. 
One is that AML is from Seoul National University. And the other is that color should express the message of the logo, boat in the ocean. 

Two preliminaries both said to me that "USE BLUE TONE".<br>

An I selected 4 colors with blue-tone and applied.
