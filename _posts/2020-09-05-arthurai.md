* Led by **Matanya Horowitz**, having PhD in Controls and Dynamical Systems from Caltech.


1. Goals
> "Our goal is to make every model **observable, equitable, and auditable** so that all designers can understand and continually improve the operations of their systems."


* AMP Robotics Applys the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to solve today’s most complicated industrial challenges and increase productivity where it’s needed most 
* **Goal** of AMP Robotics is to reduce waste by changing the economics of recycling and making it more sustainable. 
* Implementing breakthrough technology hat automates the identification, sorting, and processing of complex waste streams to extract maximum value for customers.
 
* **Business Area** : material recovery facilities (MRFs) and recycling businesses that process municipal solid waste, construction and demolition debris, e-waste, and auto-scrap. 

# 1. Technology / Product
> AMP Robotics' Tech is All About **Productivity**
  
### 1.1. AMP Cortex™

<iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/323866332" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>

* High-speed, intelligent robotics system designed to meet the demanding needs of today’s recycling operations. 

* Guided by AI, its robots intelligently perform physical tasks of sorting, picking and placing material.

### 1.2. AMP Neuron™

<img src = "https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HorowitzNeuron-274x300.png">

* AMP Neuron™ is AI platform that uses computer vision to distinguish material features similar to the human eye. 
* Neuron transforms images into data to recognize patterns, using ML to train itself by processing millions of material images within an ever expanding neural network of robotic installations.

* Neuron guides Cortex robots to perform human-like tasks, by identifying different shapes, colors, sizes and textures to sort and pick in the material stream. Neuron’s pinpoint accuracy is capable of recognizing the Brand of packaging or even a SKU (stock keeping unit) on material targeted.
* Key Feature for the Harshest Environments
  * Continually improves over time and Increases accuracy as it learns
  * Learns entirely new classes of material and also Adapts to the changes in packaging design
  * Adjusts to different lighting conditions
  * Performs in varied burden depths
<br>

### 1.3. AMP Insights™
* Online data visualization tool that  monitors material stream activity, measures performance, and helps you make informed operational decisions.

* Customer can know everything that is happening on lines. Data captured triggers real-time notifications that sends text and email alerts to you based on your settings.

* AMP Insights™ Turns Data into Decisions by 
  * Visual notifications help manage productivity
  * Informing equipment issues and hazards
  * Reporting reduces time consuming manual record keeping
  * Know value created or lost on ‘residual lines’ 
  * Quantify value per hauling load

# 2. Industries

### 2.1. Single-Stream Recycling
<iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/321804785" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

* In Single-Stream Recycling, AMP Cortex handles a full array of MSW fractions including plastics, cartons, cardboard, cups, aluminum, and thin film. 
* And Materials can be identified precisely down to the SKU(Stock-Keeping Unit) and Brand offering data transparency and categorization to unprecedented granular levels.

* Material Types
