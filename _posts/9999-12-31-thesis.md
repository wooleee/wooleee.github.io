# 0. To Start with..
Departed from company which I worked for 4 years. And I entered to Data Science Universe with solid decision with full of philosophy. 
The philosophy is based on 'Making Good AI'.

But graduation with good thesis paper and project stands before just pursuing philosophy. As follow is regarding my thesis topic.

# 1. Direction

I want my thesis to be <br>1) About Computer vision(especially Genertive Model)<br> 2) Pursuing Good AI and <br>3) Marketability.

Drawn venn diagram above, the thesis topic can be drawn from the union of three squares. So what is it?

# 2. Conference
Conference I found is **CV-COPS** which is abbreviation of "Computer Vision Challenges and Opportunities for Privacy and Security". 
- [CV-COPS2020](https://cvcops20.cispa.saarland/#)
- [CV-COPS2019](https://cvcops19.cispa.saarland/)

CV-COPS welcomes original research papers and extended abstracts on topics including, but not limited to:

- Computer vision-based security and privacy attacks
- Biometric spoofing, defenses and liveness detection
